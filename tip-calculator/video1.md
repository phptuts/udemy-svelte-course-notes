#  Project Setup

Let's get start.  Links to the code and notes in the resources.  In this series I am going to be usig visual studio code.  You can download it at https://code.visualstudio.com.  

You will also need to download the svelte extension for visual studio code.  Click on the extension button and type in svelte.  It should be the first on the comes up.  All you will need to do is install it.  Optionally you can install prettier for code formatting.  

You will also need to install nodejs as well.  Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version.


1. Open visual studio code to the project folder you are going to use for your tip calculator.

2. Open a terminal on visual studio code and type in 

```base
npx degit sveltejs/template .
npm install 
npm run dev
```

3. Go to your local website, localhost:3000 and make sure that svelte is running.
