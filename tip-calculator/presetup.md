#  Project Setup

Let's get started.  Links to the code and notes in the resources.  In this series I am going to be using visual studio code as my code editor.  You can download it at https://code.visualstudio.com.  

You will also need to download and install the svelte extension for visual studio code.  Click on the extension button and type in svelte.  It should be the first one that comes up.   

You will also need to install nodejs.  Go to nodejs.org and download & install the latest version.
